# TravellingSalesman
A brute-force searching program in order to calculate the minimum distance while visiting all destination points from the starting point and ending there.   

[Heap's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm) was used to calculate all permutations of possible routes.   

[StdDraw](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/stdlib.jar) is used to plot the points and the roads.

## How To Use?

Make sure you imported stdlib.jar into your project. After that, run Main.java   

In the following StdDraw window, first press 'S' key to place the starting point.   

After that, you can place up-to 10 destination points with the 'D' key. After 10 destination points have been placed, program will automatically start calculating the minimum distance route.   

If you want to calculate earlier and not use 10 points, simply press 'X' key at any given time.   

This 10-point restriction is to prevent insane search times and/or out of memory errors.
